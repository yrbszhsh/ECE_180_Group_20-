# Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to propose proper solutions on traffics of San Diego. Our analysis is based on time and geospatial data. We will make some suggestions on new transit lines through analyzing Traffic volumes and Street Repair Line Segments in San Diego. In addition, we would like to propose a nicer solution for the traffic issue during rush hours.  These advices may lead to improvements of the city through creating or remodel the transportation infrastructure. 

# Data Acquisition and Analysis 
We will extract the data within the recent five years. Our approach to the data will be to map and critically analyze the traffic volumes street by street, highway by highway. Moreover, we will analyze the data based on dates. One of our hypothesis is that the traffic will be heavy during holidays. One important factor we plan to consider for optimizing the routine of public transportation is the current street constructions and repairment. We plan to use the Pandas, Numpy and Googlemaps modules for data processing.<br> 
Our analysis is mainly based on the open datasets from City of San Diego Open Data website:
[https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/traffic-volumes/](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/traffic-volumes/), <br>
[https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/streets-repair-segments/](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/streets-repair-segments/), <br>
